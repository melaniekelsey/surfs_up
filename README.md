# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the Project: Weather Analysis for Surfs Up Ice Cream and Surf Shop

For this project, I was tasked with doing a weather analysis for a prospective investment and business partner in my Ice Cream and Surf Shop business in Hawaii. I examined weather patterns for a potential shop location to determine if the business idea would viable and profitable yearround based on weather patterns in the area. 

I was asked to examine the June and December weather data, to get a sense of weather patterns for two different times of year. 

## Results

In examining all of the data and pulling multiple different queries, I have determined 3 major differences in June and December weather patterns. 
Here is a overall summary of weather stats for both June and December.

### Average Temperature
As you can see from the images above, the average temperatures differs only slightly. In June, the average temperature is about 75 degrees, while in December it's about 71 degrees. Not surprising that a winter month might tend to stay a bit cooler than a summer month on average. In my opinion, 71-75 degrees would be perfect ice cream and surfing weather. 

### Highs and Lows in Temperature
The range of highs and lows is a bit smaller in June. with a low of 64 degrees and a high of 85 degrees. In December, the low is 56 degrees and a high of 83 degrees. Though there is a wider range in December, it's not so cold that people would be deterred from eating ice cream or surfing. 

### Standard Deviation
Despite the fact that there is a wider range of highs and lows between the two months, if you look at the chart below and also examine their relatively similar standard deviation, (June is 3.26 and December is 3.75) you can see that most of the weather observations are concentrated around their average temperatures.

Though you may be concerned about the cooler temperature in December, as you can see from the histogram chart above, the majority of the weather observations are in the 65 to 75 degree range, showing that the weather stays pretty warm on average with a rare chillier or hotter day. 

#### Summary
In summary, Hawaii seems to have ideal weather for the Ice Cream and Surf shop. Weather in the 70's is not too hot and not too cold, providing the ideal environment to chill on the beach and eat an ice cream, or cool down in the waves pretty much yearround according to this information. Looking at the chart, you can see that the extreme temperature swings are really rare and it most likely won't affect our traffic. 

Before we make any final decisions, I have a few more suggestions of queries we could perform to confirm our suspicions and cement our plans to start this business together. 

### Precipitation Analysis
I think it would be worth it to further examine the precipitation and rain patterns in the area. I know from experience that Hawaii can be pretty humid. Some further analysis on the humidity and rain would help us determine the ideal location. The more humid and rainy areas might not be idea for an Ice Cream Shop. I'd like to examine the rain patterns for both June and December to see how the precipitation patterns differ for those two months.  

### Extreme Weather Analysis
I think it would be good to also look at the frequency of thunder and lightning storms, as well as extreme weather like tsunamis. With global warming, there seems to be more instances of extreme weather as the years go by. It might be worth it to try to pinpoint frequency and location of these extreme weather instances to plan for the future. The last thing we would want to do is start a business in a tsunami zone and have to deal with that danger and risk. 

### Location
I also believe we need to map out ideal locations. We need to be near enough to a good surfing area to attract retail customers for the surfshop, but also in an area to attract tourists looking for an ice cream treat. We all love a good secret surf spot, but it can't be so secret that we don't get a steady stream of customers. 

I am feeling really optimistic about our business. I will look to tackle these other queries to confirm how to move forward with our business plan.
